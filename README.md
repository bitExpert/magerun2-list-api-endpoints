## Installation

The preferred way of installing `bitexpert/magerun2-list-api-endpoints` is through Composer.
Simply add `bitexpert/magerun2-list-api-endpoints` as a dev dependency:

```
composer.phar require --dev bitexpert/magerun2-list-api-endpoints
```

### Local installation

If you do not want to add the command to one specific project only, you can install the plugin globally by placing the
code in the `~/.n98-magerun2/modules` directory. If the folder does not already exist in your setup, create the folder
by running the following command:

```
mkdir -p  ~/.n98-magerun2/modules
```

The next thing to do is to clone the repository in a subdirectory of `~/.n98-magerun2/modules`:

```
git clone git@github.com:bitExpert/magerun2-list-api-endpoints.git ~/.n98-magerun2/modules/magerun2-list-api-endpoints
```

## Usage

This plugin adds the `api:list:endpoints` command to magerun2.

You are able to filter routes by their respective HTTP methods. To only
see `GET` routes, run magerun2 like this:

```
magerun2 api:list:endpoints --method=get
```

To list all `GET` and `POST` routes, pass a comma-separated list as method argument:

```
magerun2 api:list:endpoints --method=get,post
```

You are able to filter routes by their url. To only see `customers` routes,
run magerun2 like this:

```
magerun2 api:list:endpoints --route=customers
```

Both filters can be combined, to show only `customers` routes with the `GET`
method, run magerun2 like this:

```
magerun2 api:list:endpoints --route=customers --method=get
```
